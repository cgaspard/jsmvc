### JSMVC - Javascript Clientside MVC

#### Documentation was out of date so I removed it.  Have a look at the sample for now to get a better understanding.

JSMVC is an MVC library that works by loading javascript based models, views and html based templates.

This project contains a sample node server that you can run locally.  Here is how to get it running:

```
git clone git https://github.com/cgaspard/jsmvc.git

npm install

npm start or node app.js

Browse to http://localhsot:8585/
```

Good luck and feel free to drop me a line if you would like some help.
